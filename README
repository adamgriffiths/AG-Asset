BASIC USAGE:

In your controller, add:

```
$this->load->spark('Asset/1.0.1');
$this->load->helper('asset');
```
This will load the Asset spark, (be sure to replace 1.0.1 with the version you have installed) and the loading in the helper will automatically load the ag_asset lib.

Then, in your view, you can use:

```
css('style.css');
js('site.js');
img('logo.jpg');
asset_path() . '/docs/download.pdf';
```
